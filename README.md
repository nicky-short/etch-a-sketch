# etch-a-sketch
TOP Project #3

Init commit will have the index.html file linked to the style.css and the main.js.  Will detail program plan below:

1.  HTML structure built for the etch-a-sketch with main game area, buttons for play features, empty divs for messages, etc.
2.  CSS written for basic design and layout of game.
3.  Basic idea: user decided grid size (up to 100). different drawing modes, one being a traditional etch-a-sketch where you can choose color and opacity, and the other being more of a traditional paint app.
4.  Javascript built for grid creation, depending on grid size selected.
